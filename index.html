        <h2>Creative Programmer</h2>
        <div class="containerCreativeProgrammer">
            <p>I love both the design side and the coding side of web development. I am drawn to the design side more,
                but after taking an Intro Javascript class I found that I like the coding side of websites as well. I
                then made it my goal to expand my coding skills so that I would be good at both coding and design.</p>

            <p>The reason why I like design more is because I am naturally a creative person and design just speaks to
                me. Whenever I see a design I break it down and analyze it. I think about all the different parts and
                pieces, what could be changed, what can stay the same, does the whole piece flows together or does it
                feel like it's not connected at all. Sometimes I think of how I would design it and what parts I would
                keep or what parts I would change. Other times I come up with a project to do that allows me to be as
                creative as need be (I'm able to think outside of the box).</p>

                        class="mx-auto d-block">
                </div>
            </div>

            <br />

            <p>I've begun to like the coding side more and more because a lot of it is puzzles and problem solving. I
                really like doing puzzles and solving problems (that's why growing up, math was one of my favorite
                subjects). I enjoy being given a problem and being able to work it out and solve it step-by-step. I
                also like knowing how things work and learning how to get them to work. That's also a lot of what
                programming is; learning how to get things to work. If you don't know how something works you look it
                up, read about it and try to understand it. Then you take what you've learned and apply it to what you
                are working on. There is probably no better feeling than being stuck on a piece of code for a long time
                and
                finally figuring it out and getting it to work.</p>
