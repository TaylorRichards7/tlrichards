			<h2>1) DIY Baked Coffee Mug</h2>
			<p class="smalllineheight"><strong>Materials:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Permanent markers or porcelain print pens</li>
					<li>Plain ceramic drinking mug</li>
					<li>Stencils (optional)</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p class="smalllineheight"><strong>Directions:</strong>
				<ol>
					<li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Final</li>
					<li>Write, draw or trace a customized message on the mug</li>
					<li>Bake for 30 minutes, then set on a cooling rack to cool</li>
					<li>Hand wash mugs before using*</li>
				</ol>
				<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Avoid washing baked mugs in the dishwasher. If gifting them, add a sweet "hand
					wash only"
					reminder on the bottom of the mug with your marker before baking</p>

			<h2 class="smalllineheight">2) DIY Marble Dipped Mugs</h2>
			<p class="smalllineheight"><strong>Materials:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Basic white ceramic mugs</li>
					<li>Nail polish (the dollar stuff is fine)</li>
					<li>Wooden skewers or toothpicks</li>
					<li>Warm water</li>
					<li>Disposable pan or bucket (it will get ruined)</li>
					<li>Nail polish remover</li>
					<li>Cotton balls or cotton pads</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p class="smalllineheight"><strong>Directions:</strong>
				<ol>
					<li>Fill a disposable pan (or something you don't mind getting permanently colored by nail polish)
						2-3" full with
						warm water. Add more or less depending on how high on your mug you'd like the color to reach
						(Make a mark on the
						inside of your pan to indicate the water level so you can fill it to the same spot each time if
						you're making
						multiple mugs) </li>
					<li>Then, add your nail polish! Pour it onto the surface of the water, adding more or less depending
						on if you'd
						like more or less white to show through your marble pattern </li>
					<li>Working super quickly, use a toothpick or skewer to swirl the nail polish across the surface of
						the water to
						help create the marble effect, but don't think too hard about it! You don't want to drive
						yourself crazy
						over-complicating a simple process and you want to move quick so the nail polish doesn't set up
						on the water.</li>
					<li>Moving equally as quick, the next step is to dunk your mug into the nail polish water. Go
						straight down and
						straight up to achieve the dipped look </li>
					<li>Move the mug to a protected surface to dry completely, avoiding rubbing the surface of the mug
						until
						completely dry. I prefer to sit mine on top of a something to elevate it a little bit (such as a
						couple skewers)
						so it doesn't stick to the surface it's drying on, and I let them sit and dry overnight before
						touching them
						again
						(For each mug you'll need to dump the water and start over, regardless of whether or not you're
						changing color,
						because the nail polish will start to set up on top of the water, it will be too thick and
						gloppy to get more
						than one dip at a time) </li>
					<li>Other than that it's a simple process of swirling and dunking! Once dry, a super light and thin
						coat of
						dishwasher safe ModPodge and your mugs will be protected when washing, too! (But hand washing to
						be safe is never
						a bad idea)</li>
				</ol>

			<h2 class="smallineheight">3) DIY Chalkboard Mug</h2>
			<p class="smalllineheight"><strong>Materials:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Porcelain mug</li>
					<li>Painter's tape</li>
					<li>Pebeo Porcelain 150 Chalkboard Paint (Don't use regular chalkboard paint, this only works with
						porcelain
						paint)</li>
					<li>Soft bristle paint brush (a watercolor brush works well)</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p><strong>Directions:</strong>
				<ol>
					<li> Make sure your mug is clean and dry </li>
					<li> Use painter's tape to mask off the part of the mug you don't want to paint, or you could skip
						this step and
						paint the whole mug. Personally, I think it looks snazzy only partially painted </li>
					<li> Apply the paint with a soft bristle brush. If you mess up just wipe the paint away with a wet
						paper towel and
						try again. Please note that this particular porcelain paint says it's not recommended for
						surfaces that come in
						contact with food. (Although it's water based and nontoxic, so I don't understand what the
						problem would be) </li>
					<li> As soon as you are done painting carefully remove the tape. If you remove it before the paint
						dries, the tape
						will be less likely to peel up the edges of the paint</li>
