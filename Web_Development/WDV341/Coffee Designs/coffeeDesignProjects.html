    <h2>Projects at Coffee Designs</h2>
    <br />

    <div class="infoContainer">
        <p>Below are the projects we are currently working on. Each project will have a description of what it is, why
            we are making it and some additional information (ex; if someone requested we make it, what it can be used
            for, are there different versions of it, etc). There will also be a release date for each product. <br />
            <strong>Notice:</strong> If you are a user, you are able to purchase the new products 2 weeks before anyone
            else.</p>
        <p>Also this is the first time that we are making clay products that aren't meant to be charms. These new
            products are supposed to be placed around your house or around rooms or even on your desk at work.</p>

            <div class="card bg-colorltBrown">
                <img class="card-img-top" src="images/unlessJar.jpg" alt="Unless Jar">

                    <h5 class="card-text">Clay Unless stone <br /> Inspiration: The Lorax</h5>
                    <p>We are making this product because The Lorax is a beloved movie all throughout the company. This
                        is something that has been in the creative stages for a while because we wanted to convey the
                        meaning of the movie in a way that could be made big or small. So we decided to keep it simple
                        by just having the Unless stone in a jar on top of a bed of sand.</p>
                </div>

                        How to Train Your Dragon</h5>
                    <p>This was a product that has been suggested to us many times. Lots of people like giving their
                        friends or family members figurines that are holding a coffee up or drinking coffee (for the
                        people that like coffee). So we've decided to make a dragon that is holding a cup of coffee and
                        this product will be fully customizable by the customer. You can make it to fit the personality
                        of the person you are giving this to.</p>

                    <h3 class="card-title">Heart Jar</h3>
                    <h5 class="card-text">Clay heart surrounded by clay stones <br /> Inspiration: Pirates of the
                        Caribbean</h5>
                    <p>This project was actually suggested by some of our staff here at Coffee Designs. This is a
                        tribute to the Pirates of the Caribbean (the first 3 movies). In Dead Mans Chest (the second
                        Pirates movie) Jack Sparrow finds a heart and in an attempt to hide it, he puts it in a jar of
                        dirt. Later he brags "I've got a jar of dirt and guess what's inside it." This is a favorite
                        scene of a lot of our workers, so we decided to make a product that captured the humor of that
                        scene as well as make a nice decoration.</p>
