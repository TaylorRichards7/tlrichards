                        <strong>Project:</strong> I was tasked with making a poster for the Treasure Island
                        Music Festival. The poster needs to say when and where it is, as well as the bands
                        that are taking part in the festival. The Treasure Island logo also needed to be
                        included on the poster
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Did:</strong>
                        I chose the image inside the logo because it makes me think of a sunset on the
                        island (which also allows the logo to stand out). I decided to use multiple
                        shades of blue because it reminds me of the ocean, since islands are surrounded
                        by water
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Learned:</strong> I learned how to put an image inside a logo,
                        how to use various fonts (and make sure those fonts look good together), and how
                        to separate text with symbols
                        <br /><br />

                        <strong>Project:</strong> For this project, my class was tasked with making a
                        t-shirt design for DMACC's International Year. This year the country was Sweden. So
                        we needed to do some research on Sweden, we needed to make 20 thumbnails for this
                        project, then a rough sketch, we also needed to choose what fonts and colors we were
                        going to use and explain why
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Did:</strong> I decided to focus on the architecture of Sweden
                        for 2 reasons, 1)I love architecture (I actually wanted to be an architect when I
                        was a sophomore in high school) and 2)most of my classmates were doing nature themed
                        designs so I wanted to do something different. There were a many buildings that were
                        special to Sweden but the one that stuck out the most to me was the Twisted
                        Skyscraper. So that's what I used as my inspiration for this design. I traced the
                        structure and used Sweden's colors to fill and shade it
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I learned:</strong> During this project I learned that if I make
                        thumbnails, the font and the colors I want to use, then designing it on the computer
                        is pretty easy because I already hav everything planned out
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>Tools I Used:</strong> I used InDesign for this project

                        <strong>Project:</strong> This project is a continuation of DMACC's International
                        Year. For this project we needed to make a poster for Sweden. The poster had to be a
                        different concept than the shirt, it had to have 10 thumbnails, a rough sketch and
                        the fonts and colors we chose and why
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Did:</strong> Since we had to use a different concept, I decided
                        to use a deer and mountain ranges for my poster. I wanted this poster to be elegant
                        and minimalist. I used a darker blue and a golden yellow for my colors, which I
                        felt were elegant. I did a simple outline of a deer and I used different shaded of
                        the golden yellow to show depth and dimension. I decides to add in a pyramid of
                        squares in the top corners because I feel like they guide your eyes down to the rest
                        of the poster
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I learned:</strong> The main thing I learned for this project is
                        how to get a few good ideas for the same topic and make those ideas work. When we
                        first got this project, I had no clue what I was going to do, but after I did a
                        little bit more research I quickly came up with 2 ideas that would both work well
                        for this project
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>Tools I used:</strong> I used Illustrator for tracing the deer and I
                        used InDesign for the rest of the poster

                        <strong>Project:</strong> For this project, I needed to make a menu brochure for Ninja
                        Sushi. The brochure needed to have all the menu items and it's prices, the Ninja Sushi logo
                        needed to be included, as well as an indicator of the menu items that were vegetarian,
                        spicy, and a Ninja Sushi special
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Did:</strong> Spacing was very important for this project, there was
                        quite a bit of information we needed to add but the brochure couldn't be too crammed or else it
                        would be hard for people to read and it wouldn't look nice either. So, planning was a
                        very big help in completing this project. Once I knew where I wanted everything to go,
                        making the brochure was easy. I used the colors blue and grey because they are simple colors
                        that go well together and can stand out when need be
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Learned:</strong> During this project I learned how important planning
                        your layout is, especially when space can be an issue. I learned how to use and implement
                        tabs in InDesign, I also learned how to put an image in front of text (while not messing up
                        the spacing of the menu)
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>Tools I Used:</strong> For this project I used Illustrator for the logo
                        (changing the color) and I used InDesign to make the menu
                    </p>

                        <strong>Project:</strong> For this project, I was tasked with making the Eat Raw!
                        newsletter. There is specific text that needs to be used, header and footers needed to be
                        used as well as consistent, pictures needed to be added in(lots of pictures were provided),
                        some text needed to continue onto another page, some text needed to be set around pictures
                        and there needed to be a mailer on the back page
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I did:</strong> I wanted this project to have an eat raw feel to it so I
                        mainly used various shades of green and brown for the newsletter. The pictures I chose are
                        related to the content it's by (there is a picture of a battery next to a paragraph that
                        talks about batteries). I also chose pictures that I really liked and I made sure that they
                        fit with the theme of the page as well. This was another project where spacing was
                        important and, again, planning the project really helped. I was able to see what articles
                        fit well together and which ones flowed into each other
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Learned:</strong> I learned how to set text around a picture with out
                        anything looking crammed, I learned how to take a piece of a front header and condense
                        it down so the other pages have a related header and I learned how to get a nice balance
                        between the amount of text and the amount of space

                        <strong>Project:</strong> My class was given the task of making a new Culinary Magazine (we
                        had 4 pages we needed to redo). The first page we were redoing is the front cover page. We
                        needed to have "Iowa Culinary Institute" on the front, we also needed to have "From DMACC
                        Classrooms to Iowa Restaurants" on the front as well and we needed to chose an image on for the
                        front (we could either make our own or use one of the many images that were provided for us to
                        use)
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I did:</strong> I decided to take a minimalist approach to the cover. I
                        wanted it to have a nice elegant look to it as well. I chose a teal and a darker teal for the
                        colors because they went well together and I would be able to make something stand out
                        if need be. I chose the image on the front because it went very well with the colors and
                        it was simple as well
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Learned:</strong> I learned how to tie everything together on a front
                        cover page. Make sure the colors, the image, and even the font and the font colors all go
                        together and don't take anything away from each other
                        <br /><br />

                        <strong>Project:</strong> This is the second page we needed to redo for the Culinary
                        Magazine. For this page we needed to format the dinner list. Make sure that the dates are
                        readable but the page shouldn't be crammed together, images are to be used, and make sure the
                        page relates to the front cover
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I did:</strong> I decided to make the heading and the footer in the same
                        dark teal that's on the front cover. Then I decided to make horizontal lines on the sides of
                        each dinner in the lighter teal color because that acts like bullet points for each event
                        date and I made the Special Events header stick out more because people love looking at
                        special events (it also relates back to the header on the front cover as well). I added
                        in the gallery of pictures at the bottom because I liked all those pictures and I felt
                        they worked well with the page and the colors go well together
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Learned:</strong> I learned how to make a page relate to the front cover
                        and I learned how to format dates so it will all fit on the same page without looking too
                        crowded, I also learned how to use font size as hierarchy
                        <br /><br />

                        <strong>Project:</strong> This is the page that has a message from the coordinator. We
                        needed to have a picture of the coordinator and the message she gives. This page also needs to
                        relate to all the other pages in this magazine as well
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I did:</strong> I wanted to keep this page simple. So I put a picture of
                        the coordinator at the top (with a banner that relates to the front cover) and I formatted
                        her message to fit into two columns and put an image under the smaller column to even out
                        the length of the two columns
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Learned:</strong> I learned how to format her message to get it all to
                        fit into two columns (without changing the text). I also learned how to keep a page simple
                        while still relating it to the rest of the magazine

                        <strong>Project:</strong> This page is for the Toque Society. This outlines what each level
                        requires (contribution amount) and what you get with each level. This page has, by far, the
                        most text so no pictures were required for this page. Although we needed to make sure that
                        all the text fit on the page without it being unreadable
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I did:</strong> The first thing I did for this page was make sure I could get
                        all the text on but still be at a size that people could read. After I got that done then I
                        styled it to fit the rest of the magazine. I figured that if I styled it first, then I wouldn't
                        be able to fit all the text on or I'd need to change the style a lot to accommodate all the text
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Learned:</strong> The biggest struggle for me on this project was
                        getting all the text to fit, so I learned how to make the text fit while still being readable
                        <br /><br />

                        <strong>Project:</strong> For this project, we needed to make a recipe book with 8 recipes in
                        it. The only things that were provided for us are the tables in the front of the recipe book
                        and the outline of the project. We needed to find recipes, pictures, make the front and back
                        covers and style everything so it all fits and looks good
                        <br />
                        <strong>What I did:</strong> I decided to choose recipes from my childhood. These are ones
                        I grew up using and each one has a story behind it. I decided to use light green, light
                        blue, brown and white for my colors because they go well together and they provide a nice,
                        calming tone to the recipe book. I wanted to color coordinate each section because that
                        allows the pages to relate to each other and that's also why I used the same format for
                        each page. This project was one of my favorites to make because I got to relive some of
                        my most fond memories while putting this project together
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Learned:</strong> I learned how to style a recipe book and format each
                        page so that it looks like the rest of the pages but it also is unique in its own way. Spacing
                        did become an issue for some of the pages but it helped me figure out how to make everything
                        fit while still keeping the same format and having the font be big enough for people to easily
                        read

                        <strong>Project:</strong> For this project, my class was tasked with covering up blemishes on
                        pictures of people. My teacher decided to give us pictures of people with acne on them because
                        removing acne is the most common blemish cover up that people do. MY teacher also wanted us to
                        chose 2 pictures to edit from the ones she provided for us
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Did:</strong> I decided to edit a picture of a girl and of a guy because I wanted
                        to know how to edit both. For both pictures it was a little difficult to make sure their skin
                        was even through out the picture and with the guy it was a little bit more tricky to clear the
                        blemishes that were under his mustache. During the editing process, I flipped back and forth
                        between the original picture and the one I edited so I could see how the blemishes looked and if
                        they were covered up enough. It was also nice to see the final picture compared to the original
                        picture when I was done editing
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Learned:</strong> I learned how to cover and clean the blemishes on pictures,
                        which has come in handy down the road when I've needed to edit my own pictures
                        <br /><br />

                        <strong>Project:</strong> For this project, my class needed to make our own Photoshop action and
                        apply it to a picture. As part of the assignment we needed to look up existing Photoshop
                        actions, download and use one, so we knew how it worked. Then we made our own following video
                        instructions
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Did:</strong> I looked at lots of different actions to get some inspiration and
                        one that inspired me was the Sunkissed action. I then made an Autumn action - it makes pictures
                        look like they were taken during Autumn. I decided to do this action because I had lots of
                        Summer pictures and I wanted to know what they looked like if they were taken later in the year
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Learned:</strong> I learned how to download and use a pre-existing action in
                        Photoshop and I learned how to make my own action in Photoshop
                        <br /><br />

                        <strong>Project:</strong> For this project we needed to choose six animal pictures and combine
                        them into three animal swaps. The animal pictures were up to us and our teacher showed us
                        examples
                        previous student's work to help get our creative juices flowing.
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Did:</strong> I decided to do an elephant's trunk and ears on a grey squirrel
                        (which is the best out of the three), my other two pictures were a frog with a turtle shell and
                        a bear with a tigers head. These other two pictures didn't turn out as well as the first one
                        did
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Learned:</strong> I learned how to combine two images and edit them to look like
                        they are from the same picture, instead of being from two different pictures
                        <br /><br />

                        <strong>Project:</strong> For this project my class needed to choose four pictures and
                        combine two of them. We needed to take the background of one and put it behind the image
                        on the other picture. My teacher showed us some examples of previous student's work to
                        inspire us
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Did:</strong> I decided to take Wonder Woman and paste her on a country
                        meadow background. It was a little tricky getting the two pictures look right but after
                        I was done, the pictures went well together
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Learned:</strong> I learned how to swap backgrounds of pictures and edit
                        the pictures so they go together

                        <strong>Project:</strong> This was the first project my class had where we colored with
                        Photoshop. My teacher gave us a folder full of black and white pictures and we needed to pick
                        one then color it using Photoshop.
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Did:</strong> I chose this picture because no one else chose it and I thought it
                        would be fun to color. My picture reminds me of a glass doll I used to have (which is why I
                        colored it the way I did)
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Learned:</strong> I learned how to make more pastel colors in Photoshop and how

                        two pictures in a neat and creative way
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Did:</strong> My picture is a profile of me and I decided to put a picture of a
                        mountain inside my profile, it didn't turn out as well as I thought it would but my second
                        picture turned out way better. The second picture from a folder of pictures my teacher provided
                        for us and I decided to use clouds as part of the double exposure because I thought clouds would
                        go well with the picture
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Learned:</strong> I learned how to make double exposed pictures and how to clean

                        <strong>Project:</strong> This project is a lot like the Acne project, the only difference is we
                        are editing our own pictures instead of pictures of someone else. My teacher took 3 pictures of
                        each of us in my class and we could choose which one we wanted to edit
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Did:</strong> I decided to choose the one where you can see my acne the most

                        with removing/covering up blemishes

                        needed to choose a background picture, and at least one picture to go into the text (my teacher
                        encouraged us to use more than one picture for the text so we could have more practice working
                        with it)

                        and put one picture on each letter.I think this project could've turned out better if I used
                        pictures that were more related to each other, but I still liked the way it turned out - each
                        picture is unique in its own way

                        <strong>Project:</strong> This was the second painting project we did in Photoshop and this was
                        probably our biggest project. My teacher gave us a paint by number book and we got to choose
                        which masterpiece we wanted to paint. After we decided which one we wanted to do, my teacher
                        gave
                        us a piece of paper with that color swatches on it and a smaller version of the colored
                        masterpiece on it and she gave us the paint by number sheet via photoshop file
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Did:</strong> The masterpiece I chose is called The Tree of Life. I chose it
                        because it looked a lot more fun to paint than some of the other pieces I saw. What really drew
                        me in was the bottom left section where it has all the different flowers and the background is
                        more textured. I knew that part was going to be more tricky to paint than any other part of the
                        piece, but I thought it would be fun to paint something challenging like that. This project
                        turned out to be a lot more fun than I thought it would, while I was painting I was able to
                        relax
                        and have a movie or TV show on in the background.

                        <strong>What I Learned:</strong> I learned how to take swatches from one page and apply them to
                        another page and I learned how to color a paint by numbers page in Photoshop
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>Tools I Used:</strong> I used Photoshop for this project

                        <strong>Project:</strong> For this project my class participated in one of Reddit's Photoshop
                        Battles. We got to choose the picture we wanted to edit, then we needed to edit it in Photoshop
                        and upload it to Reddit. Since this was a contest, the person with the most likes on their
                        picture got a special prize
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Did:</strong> I decided to go with a picture of a worker climbing rocks by a
                        machine and immediately I knew what I wanted to do. The first thing I thought of when I saw that
                        picture was when there is a dragon in a movie or TV show and they are waking up and the
                        characters have to hide so the dragon doesn't see them. This also reminded me a scene from the
                        first Shrek movie when Donkey first sees the dragon but you can only see it's eye through a hole
                        in the wall. So all that was my inspiration to make this picture and me and another one of my
                        classmates tied for first in the photoshop battle
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Learned:</strong> I didn't really learn anything new during this project, I just
                        got to work on my Photoshop skills more
                        <br /><br />

                        <strong>Project:</strong> For this project my class needed to choose a picture and put text over
                        that picture, however you should still be able to see the picture through the text
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Did:</strong> I chose this picture because I thought it was very nicely taken and
                        I though it would be a nice picture to use for this project
                        <br /><br />
