                        <strong>Class:</strong> Communication Design 2, Summer 2018<br /><br />
                        <strong>Project:</strong> For this project, my class was tasked with making a
                        t-shirt design for DMACC's International Year. This year the country was Sweden. So
                        we needed to do some research on Sweden, we needed to make 20 thumbnails for this
                        project, then a rough sketch, we also needed to choose what fonts and colors we were
                        going to use and explain why
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Did:</strong> I decided to focus on the architecture of Sweden
                        for 2 reasons, 1)I love architecture (I actually wanted to be an architect when I
                        was a sophomore in high school) and 2)most of my classmates were doing nature themed
                        designs so I wanted to do something different. There were a many buildings that were
                        special to Sweden but the one that stuck out the most to me was the Twisted
                        Skyscraper. So that's what I used as my inspiration for this design. I traced the
                        structure and used Sweden's colors to fill and shade it
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I learned:</strong> During this project I learned that if I make
                        thumbnails, the font and the colors I want to use, then designing it on the computer
                        is pretty easy because I already hav everything planned out
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>Tools I Used:</strong> I used InDesign for this project
                    </p>

                        <strong>Project:</strong> This project is a continuation of DMACC's International
                        Year. For this project we needed to make a poster for Sweden. The poster had to be a
                        different concept than the shirt, it had to have 10 thumbnails, a rough sketch and
                        the fonts and colors we chose and why
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Did:</strong> Since we had to use a different concept, I decided
                        to use a deer and mountain ranges for my poster. I wanted this poster to be elegant
                        and minimalist. I used a darker blue and a golden yellow for my colors, which I
                        felt were elegant. I did a simple outline of a deer and I used different shaded of
                        the golden yellow to show depth and dimension. I decides to add in a pyramid of
                        squares in the top corners because I feel like they guide your eyes down to the rest
                        of the poster
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I learned:</strong> The main thing I learned for this project is
                        how to get a few good ideas for the same topic and make those ideas work. When we
                        first got this project, I had no clue what I was going to do, but after I did a
                        little bit more research I quickly came up with 2 ideas that would both work well
                        for this project
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>Tools I used:</strong> I used Illustrator for tracing the deer and I
                        used InDesign for the rest of the poster

                        <strong>Project:</strong> My class was given the task of making a new Culinary Magazine (we
                        had 4 pages we needed to redo). The first page we were redoing is the front cover page. We
                        needed to have "Iowa Culinary Institute" on the front, we also needed to have "From DMACC
                        Classrooms to Iowa Restaurants" on the front as well and we needed to chose an image on for the
                        front (we could either make our own or use one of the many images that were provided for us to
                        use)
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I did:</strong> I decided to take a minimalist approach to the cover. I
                        wanted it to have a nice elegant look to it as well. I chose a teal and a darker teal for the
                        colors because they went well together and I would be able to make something stand out
                        if need be. I chose the image on the front because it went very well with the colors and
                        it was simple as well
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Learned:</strong> I learned how to tie everything together on a front
                        cover page. Make sure the colors, the image, and even the font and the font colors all go

                        <strong>Project:</strong> This is the second page we needed to redo for the Culinary
                        Magazine. For this page we needed to format the dinner list. Make sure that the dates are
                        readable but the page shouldn't be crammed together, images are to be used, and make sure the
                        page relates to the front cover
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I did:</strong> I decided to make the heading and the footer in the same
                        dark teal that's on the front cover. Then I decided to make horizontal lines on the sides of
                        each dinner in the lighter teal color because that acts like bullet points for each event
                        date and I made the Special Events header stick out more because people love looking at
                        special events (it also relates back to the header on the front cover as well). I added
                        in the gallery of pictures at the bottom because I liked all those pictures and I felt
                        they worked well with the page and the colors go well together
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Learned:</strong> I learned how to make a page relate to the front cover
                        and I learned how to format dates so it will all fit on the same page without looking too
                        crowded, I also learned how to use font size as hierarchy

                        <strong>Project:</strong> This is the page that has a message from the coordinator. We
                        needed to have a picture of the coordinator and the message she gives. This page also needs to
                        relate to all the other pages in this magazine as well
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I did:</strong> I wanted to keep this page simple. So I put a picture of
                        the coordinator at the top (with a banner that relates to the front cover) and I formatted
                        her message to fit into two columns and put an image under the smaller column to even out
                        the length of the two columns
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Learned:</strong> I learned how to format her message to get it all to
                        fit into two columns (without changing the text). I also learned how to keep a page simple
                        while still relating it to the rest of the magazine

                        <strong>Project:</strong> This page is for the Toque Society. This outlines what each level
                        requires (contribution amount) and what you get with each level. This page has, by far, the
                        most text so no pictures were required for this page. Although we needed to make sure that
                        all the text fit on the page without it being unreadable
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I did:</strong> The first thing I did for this page was make sure I could get
                        all the text on but still be at a size that people could read. After I got that done then I
                        styled it to fit the rest of the magazine. I figured that if I styled it first, then I wouldn't
                        be able to fit all the text on or I'd need to change the style a lot to accommodate all the text
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Learned:</strong> The biggest struggle for me on this project was
                        getting all the text to fit, so I learned how to make the text fit while still being readable

                        <strong>Project:</strong> For this project, my class was tasked with covering up blemishes on
                        pictures of people. My teacher decided to give us pictures of people with acne on them because
                        removing acne is the most common blemish cover up that people do. MY teacher also wanted us to
                        chose 2 pictures to edit from the ones she provided for us
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Did:</strong> I decided to edit a picture of a girl and of a guy because I wanted
                        to know how to edit both. For both pictures it was a little difficult to make sure their skin
                        was even through out the picture and with the guy it was a little bit more tricky to clear the
                        blemishes that were under his mustache. During the editing process, I flipped back and forth
                        between the original picture and the one I edited so I could see how the blemishes looked and if
                        they were covered up enough. It was also nice to see the final picture compared to the original
                        picture when I was done editing
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Learned:</strong> I learned how to cover and clean the blemishes on pictures,
                        which has come in handy down the road when I've needed to edit my own pictures

                        combine two of them. We needed to take the background of one and put it behind the image
                        on the other picture. My teacher showed us some examples of previous student's work to
                        inspire us
                        <br /><br />
                        <strong>What I Did:</strong> I decided to take Wonder Woman and paste her on a country

                        I was done, the pictures went well together

                        needed to choose a background picture, and at least one picture to go into the text (my teacher
                        encouraged us to use more than one picture for the text so we could have more practice working
                        with it)

                        <strong>What I Did:</strong> I decided to have my word be Hello because it's simple and it's a

                        and put one picture on each letter.I think this project could've turned out better if I used
                        pictures that were more related to each other, but I still liked the way it turned out - each
                        picture is unique in its own way

                        card, have a color scheme and have a slogan or info on the card too.

                        Coffee Designs name when I was younger and I added the name to any gift I made (it had become a
                        trademark of my gifts). Coffee Designs is such a versatile name it could be a company for
                        essentially anything. Which is why I keep using it. In this case Coffee Designs is a handmade
                        jewelry making company. I chose the color scheme because these colors aren't unusual for
                        handmade jewelry making companies. I designed the logo so that it would be simple enough to be
                        put on a metal stamp and stamped into metal (if a logo is too complex not all the details
                        will show up). I also came up with the slogan on the back. I wanted this card to be modern and
                        simple.

                        <strong>What I Learned:</strong> I learned how to make a business card that reflects the company
                        it's for
                        <br /><br />
